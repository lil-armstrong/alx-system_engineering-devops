## 1 - install nginx web server
	Web servers are the piece of software generating and serving HTML pages, let’s install one!

Requirements:

    Install nginx on your web-01
    server
    Nginx should be listening on port 80
    When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
    As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
    You can’t use systemctl for restarting nginx

## 2. Setup domain name
	.TECH Domains is one of the top domain providers. They are known for the stability and quality of their DNS hosting solution. We partnered with .TECH Domains so that you can learn about DNS.

Provide the domain name in your answer file.

Requirement:

    provide the domain name only (example: foobar.tech), no subdomain (example: www.foobar.tech)
    configure your DNS records with an A entry so that your root domain points to your web-01 IP address Warning: the propagation of your records can take time (~1-2 hours)
    go to your profile and enter your domain in the Project website url field

    You answer file should be a Bash script containing commands to automatically configure a Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
    Using what you did with 1-install_nginx_web_server, write 3-redirection so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task

Requirements:

    The page must return an HTTP 404 error code

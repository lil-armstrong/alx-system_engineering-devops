**ShellCheck - A shell script static analysis tool**

> `ShellCheck` is a GPLv3 tool that gives warnings and suggestions for bash/sh shell scripts.

`Shellcheck` is a tool that will help you write proper Bash scripts. It will make recommendations on your syntax and semantics and provide advice on edge cases that you might not have thought about. `Shellcheck` is your friend! **All your Bash scripts must pass `Shellcheck` without any error or you will not get any points on the task**.

`Shellcheck` is available on the schoolâ€™s computers. If you want to use it on your own computer, here is how to [install it](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/jbz0_-i3TV3WpKgxhyrtpA).

## Tasks

### 0. Create a SSH RSA key pair

Read for this task:

-   [Linux and Mac OS users](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Cy1plV2eR3VphjPqliXB8A)
-   [Windows users](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/PXriGT0IKaSXC7L5l0CVag)

man: `ssh-keygen`

You will soon have to manage your own servers concept page hosted on remote data centers. We need to set them up with your RSA public key so that you can access them via SSH.

**Create a RSA key pair.**

Requirements:

-   Share your public key in your answer file `0-RSA_public_key.pub`
-   Fill the SSH public key field of your intranet profile with the public key you just generated
-   Keep the private key to yourself in a secure location, you will use it later to connect to your servers using SSH. Some storing ideas are Dropbox, Google Drive, password manager, USB key. Failing to do so will prevent you to access your servers, which will prevent you from doing your projects
-   If you decide to add a passphrase to your key, make sure to save this passphrase in a secure location, you will not be able to use your keys without the passphrase

SSH and RSA keys will be covered in depth in a later project.

### 1. For Best School loop

Write a Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times.

Requirement:

-   You must use the for loop (`while` and `until` are forbidden)

Requirements:

-   You must use the `until` loop (`for` and `while` are forbidden)

-   You must use the if statement

### 5. 4 bad luck, 8 is your chance

-   displays `good luck` for the 8th loop iteration
-   displays `Best School` for the other iterations

Requirements:

-   You must use the `while` loop (`for` and `until` are forbidden)
-   You must use the `if`, `elif` and `else` statements

### 6. Superstitious numbers

Write a Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 20 and:

-   displays `4` and then `bad luck from China` for the 4th loop iteration
-   displays `9` and then `bad luck from Japan` for the 9th loop iteration
-   displays `17` and then `bad luck from Italy` for the 17th loop iteration

Requirements:

-   You must use the while loop (for and until are forbidden)
-   You must use the case statement

### 7. Clock

Write a Bash script that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes:

-   You must use the `while` loop (`for` and `until` are forbidden)

Note that in this example, we only display the first 70 lines using the head command.

### 8. For ls

Write a Bash script that displays:

-   The content of the current directory
-   In a list format
-   Where only the part of the name after the first dash is displayed (refer to the example)

Requirements:

-   You must use the for loop (`while` and `until` are forbidden)
-   Do not display hidden files

### 9. To file, or not to file

**Requirements:**

-   You must use if and, else (case is forbidden)
-   Your Bash script should check if the file exists and print:
    -   if the file exists: school file exists
    -   if the file does not exist: school file does not exist
-   If the file exists, print:
-   if the file is empty: school file is empty
-   if the file is not empty: school file is not empty
-   if the file is a regular file: school is a regular file
-   if the file is not a regular file: (nothing)

## IP address classes

-   **Default Network:** The special network 0.0.0.0 is generally used for routing.

-   **Class A:** From the table above you see that there are 126 class A networks. These networks consist of 16,777,214 possible IP addresses that can be assigned to devices and computers. This type of allocation is generally given to very large networks such as multi-national companies.

-   **Loopback:** This is the special 127.0.0.0 network that is reserved as a loopback to your own computer. These addresses are used for testing and debugging of your programs or hardware.

-   **Class B:** This class consists of 16,384 individual networks, each allocation consisting of 65,534 possible IP addresses. These blocks are generally allocated to Internet Service Providers and large networks, like a college or major hospital.

-   **Class C:** There is a total of 2,097,152 Class C networks available, with each network consisting of 255 individual IP addresses. This type of class is generally given to small to mid-sized companies.

-   **Class D:** The IP addresses in this class are reserved for a service called Multicast.

-   **Class E:** The IP addresses in this class are reserved for experimental use.

-   **Broadcast:** This is the special network of 255.255.255.255, and is used for broadcasting messages to the entire network that your computer resides on

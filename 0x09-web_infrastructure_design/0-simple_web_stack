# What is a server?

	A server is a physical or virtual machine whose sole purpose is to provide services to other machines, known as clients, usually over a network


# What is the role of the domain name?

	The domain name is simply a human-friendly alias for an machine's 32-bit IP address. For example: www.foobar.com can be the domain name for the IP address: 8.8.8.8


# What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com?

	In the scenario we are depicting, the DNS record of www.foobar.com is a CNAME DVS record. www is a subdomain of the domain name foobar.com

# What is the role of the web server

	The main role of a web server is to serve web pages over the HTTP protocol to the clients

# What is the role of the application server

	The main role of a application server is to serve handle complex server side business logic and access to the database, providing the appropriate services

# What the server uses to communicate with the client

	Since the schematic diagram depicts a web interaction between the client and the server, the server uses the HTTP network protocol to communicate with the client

# ISSUES

	- This setup has a single point of failure problem. If the web server were to have any problems, the whole communication between the client will be interrupted.

	- The downtime could range from hours to days whenever a maintenance operation is performed on the server. This also will interrupt the client's communication with the service

	- Cannot scale if the traffic increases over time. This system is susceptible to attacks such as DDos attack and can only handle a limited number of request at any point in time
